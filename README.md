# <span style="color:#0366d6;">Ember</span>: A Compositional Framework for Compound AI Systems

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

## Ember in a Nutshell

Aspirationally, Ember is to Networks of Networks (NONs) Compound AI Systems development what PyTorch 
and XLA are to Neural Networks (NN) development. It's a compositional framework with both eager 
execution affordances and graph execution optimization capabilities. It enables users to compose 
complex NONs, and supports automatic parallelization and optimization of these. 

Ember's vision is to enable development of **compound AI systems composed of, one day, millions-billions of calls** and beyond. Simple constructs--like **best-of-N graphs**, **verifier-prover structures**, and **ensembles with “voting-based” aggregation**--work surprisingly well in many regimes. 

This led us to believe that there is a rich architecture space for constructing and optimizing what we call “networks of networks” graphs, or **NONs**. This is analogous to how neural network architecture research uncovered many emergent properties of systems composed of simple artificial neurons. It would be frictionful to conduct NN research if we had to implement architectures from scratch via for-loops or implement bespoke libraries for vectorization and efficient execution. Similarly, it can be challenging at present to compose NON architectures of many calls, despite the **rapidly falling cost-per-token of intelligence**.

Ember's goal is to help unlock research and practice along this new frontier.

from ember.api import non
from ember.api.models import EmberModel

## Core Elements

1. **Composable Operators with Rigorous Specification**: Build reliable compound AI systems from 
   type-safe, reusable components with validated inputs and outputs
2. **Automatic Parallelization**: Independent operations are automatically executed concurrently 
   across a full computational graph
3. **XCS Optimization Framework**: Just-in-time tracing and execution optimization inspired by JAX/XLA 
4. **Multi-Provider Support**: Unified API across OpenAI, Anthropic, Claude, Gemini, and more 
   with standardized usage tracking

## Installation

```bash
# Quick install using uv (recommended)
uv pip install ember-ai

# Run directly without installing (fastest)
uvx ember-ai  # If you have a CLI command

# Or from source
git clone https://github.com/pyember/ember.git
cd ember
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run examples directly with uv
uv run python src/ember/examples/basic/minimal_example.py

# Or install using pip (alternative)
pip install ember-ai
```

## Model Registry & Provider Integration

Access models from any provider through a unified interface:

```python
from ember import initialize_ember
from ember.api.models import ModelEnum

# Initialize with multiple providers
service = initialize_ember(usage_tracking=True)

# Access models from different providers with the same API
response = service(ModelEnum.OPENAI_GPT4O, "What is quantum computing?")
print(response.data)

# Track usage across providers
usage = service.usage_service.get_total_usage()
print(f"Total cost: ${usage.cost:.4f}")
```

## NON Patterns & Ensembling

Build compound AI system architectures using the Network of Networks (NON) pattern with pre-built components:

```python
from ember.api import non

# 1. Create an ensemble of 5 model instances that run in parallel
# This improves statistical robustness through multiple independent samples
ensemble = non.UniformEnsemble(
    num_units=5, 
    model_name="openai:gpt-4o-mini",
    temperature=0.7
)

# 2. Create a judge to synthesize the ensemble responses
# This combines multiple perspectives into a coherent, reasoned answer
judge = non.JudgeSynthesis(
    model_name="anthropic:claude-3-sonnet",
    temperature=0.2
)

# 3. Create a verifier to independently check the final output
# This adds a quality control layer for factual accuracy and coherence
verifier = non.Verifier(
    model_name="anthropic:claude-3-haiku",
    temperature=0.0
)

# 4. Chain components together in a sequential pipeline
# Ember automatically optimizes the execution graph
pipeline = non.Sequential(operators=[ensemble, judge, verifier])

# Execute the entire pipeline with a single call
result = pipeline(query="What causes tsunamis?")
```

## Graph Optimization & Execution

Ember's XCS system provides JAX/XLA-inspired tracing, transformation, and automatic parallelization:

```python
from ember.api.xcs import jit, structural_jit, execution_options, vmap

# Basic JIT compilation for simple optimization
@jit
class SimplePipeline(Operator):
    # ... operator implementation ...

# Advanced structural JIT with parallel execution strategy
@structural_jit(execution_strategy="parallel")
class ComplexPipeline(Operator):
    def __init__(self):
        self.op1 = SubOperator1()
        self.op2 = SubOperator2()
        self.op3 = SubOperator3()
    
    def forward(self, *, inputs):
        # These operations will be automatically parallelized when the execution graph is built
        result1 = self.op1(inputs=inputs)
        result2 = self.op2(inputs=inputs)
        
        # Combine the parallel results
        combined = self.op3(inputs={"r1": result1, "r2": result2})
        return combined

# Configure execution parameters
with execution_options(max_workers=8):
    result = pipeline(query="Complex question...") 

# Vectorized mapping for batch processing
@vmap
def process_batch(inputs, model):
    return model(inputs)
```

## Data Handling & Evaluation

Ember provides a comprehensive data processing and evaluation framework with pre-built datasets and metrics:

```python
from ember.api.data import DatasetBuilder, EvaluationPipeline, Evaluator

# Load a dataset with the builder pattern
dataset = (DatasetBuilder()
    .from_registry("mmlu")  # Use a registered dataset
    .subset("physics")      # Select a specific subset
    .split("test")          # Choose the test split
    .sample(100)            # Random sample of 100 items
    .transform(              # Apply transformations
        lambda x: {"query": f"Question: {x['question']}"} 
    )
    .build())

# Create a comprehensive evaluation pipeline
eval_pipeline = EvaluationPipeline([
    # Standard metrics
    Evaluator.from_registry("accuracy"),
    Evaluator.from_registry("response_quality"),
    
    # Custom evaluation metrics
    Evaluator.from_function(
        lambda prediction, reference: {
            "factual_accuracy": score_factual_content(prediction, reference)
        }
    )
])

# Evaluate a model or operator
results = eval_pipeline.evaluate(my_model, dataset)
print(f"Accuracy: {results['accuracy']:.2f}")
print(f"Response Quality: {results['response_quality']:.2f}")
print(f"Factual Accuracy: {results['factual_accuracy']:.2f}")
```
